# Enhanced Traveller Screening

### A component of the COVID-19 response

---

## Introduction

This is a digital service built in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Service B.C. which supports British Columbians returning from out-of-country to self isolate. Travellers complete a self isolation plan which may be reviewed with a provincial official to determine whether they require additional support in order to self isolate. In addition, Service BC is able to followup with travellers to ensure the success of their self isolation plan.

## Development

### Using Docker

Make sure you have Docker and Docker-compose installed in your local environment. For instructions on how to install it, follow the links below:
- https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

To set up and run database, backend (server), and frontend (client) applications:
- Run `make local` within the root folder of the project

To tear down your environment:
- Run `make close-local`

To migrate from dynamoDB to MongoDB/DocumentDB database:
- Run DynamoDB 
  - `docker run -p 8000:8000 --name dynamoDB --network=enhanced-travel-screening_frontend amazon/dynamodb-local`
  - `enhanced-travel-screening` represents the folder name of your project directory
  - Keep in mind if you were not using
- Run the migration script
  - `make local-db-migration`

To seed database, run:
- `make local-db-seed`

To run server tests:
- Make sure containers are running
  - `make local`
- Shell into the server container by running
  - `make local-server-workspace` 
  - `npm test`
- or by running
  - `make local-server-tests`

### Using npm

From both the client and the server folders, run `npm i` to install dependencies.

- Add a hostname alias to your environment
- - Edit your `/etc/hosts` filename
- - Add `127.0.0.1   server`


- Run client: `npm start` run within client folder
- Start Database: `make run-local-db`
- Once the DB is running, `npm run db:seed` to seed the database
- Run server: `npm run watch` from within the server folder
- Run server tests: `npm test` from within the server folder

Communication from front end to back end is facilitated by [the proxy field](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) in client package.json.

### Front End Views

##### /form
 - allows a traveller to submit their traveller data and receive a confirmation number

##### /confirmation/:formId
 - redirect here after form submission, display confirmation number and retrieve the health status and isolation plan status from the server's response to the form submission.
 - display statuses as friendly icons
 - button to download a PDF version of traveller submission

##### /login
- allows an admin to login

##### /lookup
- single input field to search for a form submission by confirmation number

##### /form/:formId
- render a static version of a form submission
- allow the admin to set a status for this submission: ["accepted", "support", "rejected"] and add notes

### API Routes

- /login [POST] validate login creds, isssue token
- /form [POST] submit new form
- /form/:id [POST] edits an existing form
- /form/:id [GET] retrieves an existing form
- In production: / [GET] serves the built client app

## Database

The application uses Amazon DocumentDB, a non-relational database, fully managed, that emulates the MongoDB 3.6 API and utilizes a distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system.

You can find more information at: 
- https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/what-is.html

Keep in mind that DocumentDB does not support all MongoDB 3.6 features and APIs. Check the link below to explore the differences:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/mongo-apis.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/functional-differences.html

For this project, there are 2 database clusters configured under private subnets inside a custom VPC. One to be used for development and staging environments and the other for the production environment.

For local development, a MongoDB 3.6 container is being used.

### Shelling into the Database [Development/Production]

Because the database clusters are not exposed to the web, we need to create a SSH tunnel to bridge a connection with the database. To do that, we need to use a bastion host inside the same VPC but exposed to the web.


```bash
ssh -i "~/.ssh/ets-bastion-host.pem" -L 27017:DOCUMENT_DB_CLUSTER_URL:27017 ec2-user@BASTION_HOST_URL -N
```

- Replace DOCUMENT_DB_CLUSTER_URL with the url the document db cluster.
- Replace BASTION_HOST_URL with the IP address or url of the bastion host.
- Now you can connect to the database using mongo shell or any mongo client as if the server was running from your localhost.
- Keep in mind, our DocumentDB clusters have TLS enabled and will require a public key to connect. You can downloaded it [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem).


You can find the cluster URLS, credentials, and certificates on the project folder on TeamPass.
