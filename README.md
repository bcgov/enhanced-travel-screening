# Enhanced Traveller Screening

### Covid 19 response app

---

### Development

From both the client and the server folders, run `npm i` to install dependencies.

- Run client: `npm start` run within client folder
- Start Database: `npm run db:start`
- Once the DB is running, `npm run db:seed` to seed the database
- Run server: `npm run watch` from within the server folder
- Run server tests: `npm test` from within the server folder

Communication from front end to back end is facilitated by [the proxy field](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) in client package.json.
